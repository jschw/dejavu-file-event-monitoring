# DéjàVu Windows File System Monitoring Tool
Simple Application that's based on the .NET FileSystemWatcher Class.

I wrote it back in 2015 originally in VB.NET, now it is ported to C# and DotNet 6.

The tool can be used to monitor up to three directories (and their sub-directories) for changes on files and folders
It is integrated into Windows as a tray icon and it can optionally send notifications if any change occur.
